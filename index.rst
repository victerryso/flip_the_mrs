This unit of study introduces the student the professional practice of diagnostic radiography of the appendicular skeleton. The techniques covered will include routine procedures that the student will encounter in the clinical setting. Anatomy, physiology and pathology will be integrated with corresponding radiographic techniques of selected body system. This unit of study introduces the student the professional practice of diagnostic radiography of the appendicular skeleton. The techniques covered will include routine procedures that the student will encounter in the clinical setting. Anatomy, physiology and pathology will be integrated with corresponding radiographic techniques of selected body systems. Planar anatomy and imaging will be included as appropriate. This unit will apply the evidence base, theory to practice and integrate basic applied sciences to imaging techniques. Students will be expected to supplement and broaden their learning by independent learning, literature review and research on relevant topics.

We recommend that students take a proactive approach to organising their study. We have created a `MRSC5001-Semester Study Template-S1/2016 <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OYwkettyIJjqx1Tjr1yY78LNhFrLO_PiAeayGLY0SHk/edit?usp=sharing>`_ which maps the semester ahead. We suggest that you download a copy and edit the document and create your own personal schedule.

You may also find the following apps useful during your study: `Blackboard <https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/blackboard-mobile-learn/id376413870?mt=8>`_ , `Piazza <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piazza/id453142230?mt=8>`_ and `DIP: Imaging Pathways <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dip-medical-diagnostic-imaging/id985073740?l>`_
