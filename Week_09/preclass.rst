To finish off the preclass work, you can work through a range of multiple choice questions (MCQ) for that week. The MCQs aim to help you to self-assess your understanding of the weeks content. There are approximately 20 questions per page and you may take as many or as few as you like.

If you are struggling with a particular question, we suggest you post your problem to `Piazza <https://piazza.com/class/ikylobq09oe6dy?cid=17>`_. However, we ask that you refrain from posting assignment solutions directly, instead we encourage you to offer some friendly direction.
