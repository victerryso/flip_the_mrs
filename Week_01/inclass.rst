8. Take the MCQ

To finish off the preclass work, you can work through a range of multiple choice questions (MCQ) for that week. The MCQs aim to help you to self-assess your understanding of the weeks content. If you are struggling with a particular question, we suggest you post your problem to `Piazza <https://piazza.com/class/ivd39iavqrk2qd>`_ However, we ask that you refrain from posting assignment solutions directly, instead we encourage you to offer some friendly direction.
