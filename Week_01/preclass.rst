===============

1. Watch an Intro Clip
----------------------
Usually, you will find a video introducing the week ahead presented by A/Prof Mark McEntee in our No. 1 spot. Week 1 is the only exception, as you will meet Mark and your classmates for an in-person introduction. For now, feel free to listen to this MRS specific song while you learn about the semester ahead.

3. MRSFLIX
-----------------------------------
Copyright pending, we have made the equivalent of Netflix but for MRS. The series you'll be addicted to this semester is "Patient Positioning", it's first season; "The Chest". In all seriousness, each video is less than 3 minutes in duration and should be reviewed to aid preparation for practicals.
