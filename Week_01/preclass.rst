A: Preclass
===============

Week 1 is unlike every other week in MRSC5001. Below, we will introduce you to each resource which will help prepare you for clinical placement and your learning. In future weeks, you will be expected to access the resources and complete the activity outlined.

1. Watch an Intro Clip
----------------------
Usually, you will find a video introducing the week ahead presented by A/Prof Mark McEntee in our No. 1 spot. However, Week 1 is the only exception, as you will meet Mark and your classmates for an in-person introduction.

2. Visit Imaging Pathways
-------------------------

`DIP: Diagnostic Imaging Pathways <http://imagingpathways.health.wa.gov.au/index.php/imaging-pathways>`_ is a locally and internationally acclaimed online decision support and educational tool. We encourage you to be proactive and resourceful, embrace self reliance and work your way through this resource at your own pace. 

DIP is also available as an app via `the App Store <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dip-medical-diagnostic-imaging/id985073740?l>`_ and `Google Play <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sigmalogic.dip>`_.

From Week 3 onwards, you will be asked to investigate which indications are appropriate for x-ray requests for the [insert weekly topic here].

3. MRSflix
-----------------------------------
Copyright pending, we have made the equivalent of Netflix but for MRS. The series you'll be addicted to this semester is "Patient Positioning", it's first season; "Week 3: The Chest". In all seriousness, each video is less than 3 minutes in duration and should be reviewed to aid preparation for practicals.

4. Read Bontrager's Handbook
----------------------------
For Week 1 only, we ask that you simply access `Bontrager's Handbook <http://opac.library.usyd.edu.au:80/record=b4698666~S4>`_ and setup your access to the resource. In future weeks, you will be asked to read the sections for [insert weekly topic here].

5. Read an Article
------------------
From week two onwards, you will find either a link to a PDF or to the library to a required reading. You will have time in the first hour of class on Monday (9AM-10AM) to discuss articles with colleagues and post relevant questions to `Piazza. <https://piazza.com/class/ikylobq09oe6dy?cid=8>`_

However, I would highly recommend bookmarking the Library Unit Readings: `<http://opac.library.usyd.edu.au/search/r?SEARCH=MRSC5001>`_

6. Post to Piazza
-----------------
`Piazza <https://piazza.com/class/ikylobq09oe6dy?cid=8>`_ is our discussion forum which will facilitate interaction among the class for the entire semester. Post a question, and problems will get unstuck with the help of your classmates and teaching staff. The site is completely searchable, so it may be quite useful during times of revision. You will have time in class on Monday (9AM-10AM) to post and answer questions.

**How to use the discussion board**
No one is expected to read every post made within `Piazza <https://piazza.com/class/ikylobq09oe6dy?cid=8>`_ Rather, read those that seem interesting to you and reply when you can further the conversation. Above all, you are expected to remain civil and treat all other students with respect.

7. Take the MCQ
-----------------
To finish off the preclass work, you can work through a range of multiple choice questions (MCQ) for that week. The MCQs aim to help you to self-assess your understanding of the weeks content. If you are struggling with a particular question, we suggest you post your problem to `Piazza <https://piazza.com/class/ikylobq09oe6dy?cid=8>`_ However, we ask that you refrain from posting assignment solutions directly, instead we encourage you to offer some friendly direction. 

MCQs will be available from Week 3 onwards.
