     **Question 61** Situation: A radiograph of a tangential, inferosuperior projection of the carpal canal reveals that the hamate is superimposed over the pisiform. Which of the following measures will correct this problem?
  
     A) :eqt:`C` Rotate the wrist and hand 10° internally
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Increase the cr angle
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Decrease the cr angle
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Increase the extension of the hand and/or wrist

     **Question 62** Situation: A patient enters the ER with a possible scaphoid fracture. The patient is unable to assume the ulnar deviation position. Which of the following positions should be performed to confirm the diagnosis?
  
     A) :eqt:`I` Gaynor-hart
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Jones
    
     #) :eqt:`C` Modified stecher
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Coyle

     **Question 63** Situation: A patient with a fractured forearm had the fracture reduced and a fiberglass cast placed on the extremity. The orthopedic surgeon orders a postreduction study. The original technique was 60 kV with 3 mAs. Which of the following techniques should be selected for the postreduction study?
  
     A) :eqt:`C` 64 kv, 3 mas
    
     #) :eqt:`I` 64 kv, 6 mas
    
     #) :eqt:`I` 60 kv, 6 mas
    
     #) :eqt:`I` 70 kv, 3 mas

     **Question 64** Situation: A patient enters the ER with an elbow injury. The partially flexed AP and lateral positions reveal a possible fracture of the coronoid process. The patient’s elbow is partially flexed and he refuses to extend it further. Which one of the following positions should be performed to confirm the fracture of the coronoid process?
  
     A) :eqt:`I` Jones method
    
     #) :eqt:`C` Coyle method with 80° flexion, cr angled 45° away from shoulder
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Coyle method with 90° flexion, cr angled 45° toward the shoulder
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Gaynor-hart method
    
  .. eqt:: mcq-05-65
    
     **Question 65** Situation: A patient with a history of carpal tunnel syndrome comes to radiology. The physician wants to rule out abnormal calcifications in the carpal sulcus. Which of the following projections would best demonstrate this region?
  
     A) :eqt:`I` Coyle method
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Jones method
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Carpal bridge
    
     #) :eqt:`C` Gaynor-hart method
    
  .. eqt:: mcq-05-66
    
     **Question 66** Situation: A radiograph of the PA scaphoid projection reveals extensive superimposition of the scaphoid and adjacent carpals. Which of the following factors can lead to this problem?
  
     A) :eqt:`I` Elevation of the hand and wrist
    
     #) :eqt:`C` Insufficient ulnar deviation
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Insufficient cr angle distally
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Slight flexion of the phalanges
    
  .. eqt:: mcq-05-67
    
     **Question 67** Situation: A lateral elbow radiograph demonstrates about half of the radial head superimposed by the coronoid process of the ulna. Which of the following occurred?
  
     A) :eqt:`I` The hand was pronated rather than in a true lateral position
    
     #) :eqt:`I` The hand and wrist were rotated laterally and not in a true lateral position
    
     #) :eqt:`I` The shoulder was not dropped sufficiently to the tabletop level
    
     #) :eqt:`C` No positioning errors occurred
    
  .. eqt:: mcq-05-68
    
     **Question 68** Situation: A young child comes to radiology with an elbow injury. The basic elbow projections demonstrate a possible nondisplaced fracture of the coronoid process. Beyond the medial oblique projection, what additional projection(s) can be performed to demonstrate the coronoid process in profile?
  
     A) :eqt:`I` Coyle method with 45° cr angle toward shoulder
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Radial head lateral projections
    
     #) :eqt:`C` Coyle method with 45° cr angle away from shoulder
    
     #) :eqt:`I` Acute flexion projection
