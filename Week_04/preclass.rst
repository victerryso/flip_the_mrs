3. MRSflix
-----------------------------------
Copyright pending, we have made the equivalent of Netflix but for MRS. The series you'll be addicted to this semester is "Patient Positioning", it's first season; "The Chest". In all seriousness, each video is less than 3 minutes in duration and should be reviewed to aid preparation for practicals.

----------------------------

6. Post to Piazza
-----------------
`Piazza. <https://piazza.com/sydney.edu.au/semester12016/mrsc5001/home>`_

**How to use the discussion board**
No one is expected to read every post made within `Piazza. <https://piazza.com/sydney.edu.au/semester12016/mrsc5001/home>`_ Rather, read those that seem interesting to you and reply when you can further the conversation. Above all, you are expected to remain civil and treat all other students with respect.

7. Take the MCQ
-----------------
To finish off the preclass work, you can work through a range of multiple choice questions (MCQ) for that week. The MCQs aim to help you to self-assess your understanding of the weeks content. If you are struggling with a particular question, we suggest you post your problem to `Piazza. <https://piazza.com/sydney.edu.au/semester12016/mrsc5001/home>`_ However, we ask that you refrain from posting assignment solutions directly, instead we encourage you to offer some friendly direction. 

MCQs will be available from this week.
